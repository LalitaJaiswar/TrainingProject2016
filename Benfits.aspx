<ul>
    <li> The most obvious advantage of them all is the cost. Rickshaws,
taxis and buses use CNG as it is a very cheap fuel and facilitates
high running with lower costs. On an average CNG costs around
half or 1/3rd the amount regular fuel. In fact, in a brief survey, a
hatch-back like the Hyundai i10 running on CNG and an entry
level sports bike like the Honda CBR250R have similar fuel costs
for an average running of around 50 kms a day.</li>
    <li>It is a greener fuel. The emissions and hydrocarbons that are
released as a by product of CNG usage are lesser than those
created by regular fuel. Carbon monoxide emissions are down by
70-85% while hydrocarbon levels are reduced by 40-60%.</li>
    <li>Engine life improves. Contrary to popular belief, CNG is actually
a better fuel for improving engine life as the carbon levels are
greatly reduced.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Economy with PNG – PNG has been positioned to be cheaper as
compared to domestic LPG. PNG saves additionally as it avoids losses on
account of less-weight, pilferage, in-complete use etc. in the case of LPG
supplied through cylinders.</li>
        <li>Un-interrupted supply – The source of PNG supply in Kanpur is the world
famous Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) pipeline of GAIL (India) Limited – a
promoter of CUGL. Distribution in the city is done by laying main steel
pipeline grid for the city and MDPE pipeline network. CUGL offers
continuous and adequate supply through its network 365 days a year, 24
hours a day. Dedicated team of engineers/technicians provides round the
clock service in case of stoppage, leakage, etc.</li>
        <li>Convenience – PNG is most convenient fuel as it is supplied 24X7 without
requiring any storage space in the kitchen, hassles of cylinder refill booking,
regular liaisoning with distribution, waiting for delivery, arguments with
delivery boys, shortage, less-weight, leaking cylinders, broken seal, excess
condensate, pilferage etc. PNG is allowed to – Use First, Pay Later. Bimonthly
gas bills are raised as per actual use metered at Consumer end
(Kitchen).</li>
